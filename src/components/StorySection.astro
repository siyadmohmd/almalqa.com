            The Gathering was founded from a beautiful moment of realisation. One day, our founder met an old friend he hadn't seen in a long time. At that unexpected meeting, he was warmly invited to the family elder's birthday celebration—a gathering filled with goodness and warmth. Although he was among people he had never known before, he felt something extraordinary: a profound sense of belonging that touched his heart.

            Because of the limited space, everyone sat together on the floor to serve everyone at once. They passed the dishes around, savoring the flavors. They shared laughter, and conversation flowed smoothly. The atmosphere was filled with joy and intimacy, and he felt that this gathering was more genuine and beautiful than any he had ever attended.

            It wasn't just the food that satisfied him that day—it was the joy of the community spirit. That's when he understood the true meaning of a gathering: a place where hearts open, strangers become family, and every bite becomes a memory that lasts forever.
